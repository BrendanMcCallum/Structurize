just for sure:

make sure things that should survive world save/load actually do survive

make sure rotation and mirroring is the same in every possible context across every possible pipelineÂ¨

=== plan ===
events - prepared
pipeline for scanning
entry point for both pipelines, check registry things are done properly
pipeline sync/save&load layers (placer percentage progress)
pipeline server/client spliting (should be almost done in previous point)
structurize world and schematic file management
online repository

=== features not in plan ===
better placeholders and components testing
BPs configurations + gui
box events, caliper box, things like that -> events plan point
move deco blocks into standalone mod, allow for chisel things etc. (vanilla?)
